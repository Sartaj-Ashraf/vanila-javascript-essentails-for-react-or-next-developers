React or Nextjs Developers' Guide to Vanilla JavaScript
These notes will help you become a more versatile developer and gain a deeper grasp of the web platform by guiding you through the re-implementation of common React patterns and features using only Vanilla JS.

Overview
These notes are for you if you are at ease using React and its ecosystem to create apps but lack confidence when working with raw JavaScript and browser APIs. We'll presume you have constructed React apps and understand the fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, and JS), but you may not have developed sophisticated apps without a framework. By demonstrating how React's abstractions translate to straightforward JavaScript methods, we'll close that gap.

You'll discover how to construct dynamic interfaces, control state, put components together, manage routing & use the platform alone to carry out side effects (no frameworks). To solidify your grasp, we'll go over the foundational concepts of JavaScript, such as closures and the event loop. After that, we'll start creating actual projects with Vanilla JS, ranging from straightforward to-do lists to more complex applications like movie explorers and more. As we go along, we'll stress utilizing a browser and editor instead of a build toolchain whenever possible. After that, we'll demonstrate how to leverage bundlers (using Vite) and even a little Node.js for backend concepts to get ready for production.

A certain facet of app development is covered in each chapter. Explanations, code samples, and analogies to how you would accomplish the same with React are all included in the chapters. We've included a number of practical projects and tutorials to help you practice the ideas.
